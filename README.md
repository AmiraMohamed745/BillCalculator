# BillCalculator

The **Bill Calculator** is a simple Android app developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It allows users to calculate the tip amount and the overall bill amount based on the bill amount and tip percentage they input. Additionally, the app provides features to round up the bill and divide it among a specified number of people. Users can also easily share the results with others via text or as a screenshot.
